100 GGoCySEA Networked Keypad
One item we noted whle manuevering through GGoCySEA Headquarters 
building was the digital keypad used to go between floors at the 
stairs. When you touch the screen there is a warning and a display 
of 0 - 9 and the letters 'A' and 'B'. We believe they are world 
accessible and may have been left in some sort of maintenance mode. 
You'll eventually need to get to the holding cells on the top floor 
and need to know what the code is ahead of time. 
Access is sometimes intermitent as these are just lightweight devices. 
If they were left active you can reach one at 
keypad.govsec.agency on port 9568.
